# Hypothesis Testing Steps

## Define the Hypotheses

Clearly define the null (**H₀**) and alternative (**H₁**) hypotheses.

## Verify Assumptions

Check the necessary conditions for the statistical test:

- **Normality**: The data should follow a normal distribution.
- **Independence**: Samples should be independently and identically distributed.
- **Outliers**: Ensure no significant outliers in the data.
- **Homogeneity of variances**: Required for certain tests (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA).

## Select the Appropriate Test

Choose the test type based on data characteristics and hypotheses:

- **Parametric tests**: Used when all assumptions are met (e.g., t-test, ANOVA).
- **Non-parametric tests**: Used when assumptions are violated (e.g., Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis test).

## Calculate the Test Statistic and p-Value

- Compute the **test statistic** using sample data.
- Determine the **p-value**, which represents the probability of obtaining the observed results under **H₀**.

## Decision Making

- Compare the **test statistic** to a critical value or the **p-value** to the significance level (\\( \\alpha \\)).
- The significance level (\\( \\alpha \\)) is the probability of rejecting **H₀** when it is actually true.

### Two Possible Outcomes

1. **Reject H₀**: There is enough evidence to support the alternative hypothesis (**H₁**).
2. **Fail to reject H₀**: Insufficient evidence to support the alternative hypothesis (**H₁**).
